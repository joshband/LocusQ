# 2026-02-23 Ops Artifacts Archive Manifest

## Purpose
Track the first documentation de-bloat move that archived non-canonical generated docs.

## Moved Paths
1. `Documentation/exports/` -> `Documentation/archive/2026-02-23-ops-artifacts/exports/`
2. `Documentation/reports/` (initial and regenerated sets) -> consolidated archive snapshot:
- `Documentation/archive/2026-02-23-ops-artifacts/reports-final/`

## Notes
1. Archived files are retained verbatim for reproducibility and historical traceability.
2. Internal links that reference pre-archive paths are historical context and intentionally unchanged.
3. Duplicate interim report sets were removed after consolidating into `reports-final/`.
