# Architecture Review Consolidation Archive

## Purpose

Preserve historical architecture review documents after consolidating their durable findings into `ARCHITECTURE.md` so the repository keeps one active architecture source-of-truth.

## Archived Files

- `reviews/2026-02-26-full-architecture-review.md`
- `reviews/LocusQ Repo Review 02262026.md`

## Consolidation Target

- `ARCHITECTURE.md`

## Notes

- These archived reviews remain referenceable for provenance and historical reasoning.
- Active architecture guidance should be updated in `ARCHITECTURE.md` first.
