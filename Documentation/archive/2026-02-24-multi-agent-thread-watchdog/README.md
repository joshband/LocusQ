# Multi-Agent Thread Watchdog Archive Bundle

## Purpose
Archive the optional multi-agent watchdog operational guide out of top-level `Documentation/` while preserving traceability.

## Contents
- `multi-agent-thread-watchdog.md`

## Reason for Archive
1. The workflow is optional and disabled by default for normal Codex sessions in this repo.
2. Keeping it under archive reduces top-level reference noise while preserving historical and operational context.

## Related
- `AGENTS.md` (multi-agent runtime section)
- `Documentation/archive/README.md`
