## Description

The research path distinguishes core monitoring implementation from verification/governance needs: profile fallback taxonomy, deterministic verification metrics, replay-stable QA artifacts, and release-governance evidence links. This intake captures the post-core backlog work required to prove headphone calibration outcomes remain deterministic and promotion-ready.

## Proposed Priority

P2 — should follow BL-033 core landing and establish deterministic validation/operations contracts for sustained maintenance and release governance.

## Dependency Guesses

- Likely depends on: BL-033
- Likely blocks: none known

## Proposed Track

Track D — QA Platform

## Next Step

- [x] Triage: assign BL/HX ID and validate dependencies (`BL-034`)
- [x] Promote: convert to full runbook in `Documentation/backlog/`
- [x] Add row to `Documentation/backlog/index.md`
- [ ] Archive this intake doc
