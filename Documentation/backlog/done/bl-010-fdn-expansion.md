# BL-010: FDN Expansion Promotion

## Plain-Language Summary

BL-010 in plain terms: Promoted the 4x4 Hadamard FDN reverb processor from experimental to production status with validated tonal stability. Current state: Done. For technical detail, see `## Objective` and `## Validation Plan`.

## 6W Snapshot (Who/What/Why/How/When/Where)

| Question | Plain-language answer |
|---|---|
| Who is this for? | Plugin users, operators, QA/release owners, and coding agents/scripts that need one reliable source of truth. |
| What is changing? | BL-010: FDN Expansion Promotion |
| Why is this important? | Promoted the 4x4 Hadamard FDN reverb processor from experimental to production status with validated tonal stability. |
| How will we deliver it? | Use the documented implementation summary and promotion gates in this closeout runbook to confirm what shipped and why it is safe. |
| When is it done? | This item is complete when promotion gates, evidence sync, and backlog/index status updates are all recorded as done. |
| Where is the source of truth? | Runbook: `Documentation/backlog/done/bl-010-fdn-expansion.md` plus repo-local evidence under `TestEvidence/...`. |

## Visual Aid Index
