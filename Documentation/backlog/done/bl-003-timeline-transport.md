## Objective

Restored play/pause/stop/scrub transport controls in production WebView UI for keyframe timeline playback.

- Playback state sync between native and WebView
- Scrub position relay

## Key Files

- `Source/KeyframeTimeline.cpp`
- `Source/KeyframeTimeline.h`
- `Source/PluginEditor.cpp`
- `Source/ui/public/js/index.js`

## Evidence References

- Production self-test baseline (part of initial P0 closeout cycle)
- `TestEvidence/build-summary.md` and `TestEvidence/validation-trend.md` entries

## Completion Date

2026-02-21


## Governance Retrofit (2026-02-28)

This additive retrofit preserves historical closeout context while aligning this done runbook with current backlog governance templates.

### Status Ledger Addendum

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Promotion Decision Packet | `Legacy packet; see Evidence References and related owner sync artifacts.` |
| Final Evidence Root | `Legacy TestEvidence bundle(s); see Evidence References.` |
| Archived Runbook Path | `Documentation/backlog/done/bl-003-timeline-transport.md` |

### Promotion Gate Summary

| Gate | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Build + smoke | Legacy closeout documented | `Evidence References` |
| Lane replay/parity | Legacy closeout documented | `Evidence References` |
| RT safety | Legacy closeout documented | `Evidence References` |
| Docs freshness | Legacy closeout documented | `Evidence References` |
| Status schema | Legacy closeout documented | `Evidence References` |
| Ownership safety (`SHARED_FILES_TOUCHED`) | Required for modern promotions; legacy packets may predate marker | `Evidence References` |

### Backlog/Status Sync Checklist

- [x] Runbook archived under `Documentation/backlog/done/`
- [x] Backlog index links the done runbook
- [x] Historical evidence references retained
- [ ] Legacy packet retrofitted to modern owner packet template (`_template-promotion-decision.md`) where needed
- [ ] Legacy closeout fully normalized to modern checklist fields where needed
