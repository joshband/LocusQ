# BL-009: Steam Headphone Contract Closeout

## Plain-Language Summary

This runbook tracks **BL-009** (BL-009: Steam Headphone Contract Closeout). Current status: **Done**. In plain terms: Established Steam Audio binaural rendering contract with deterministic headphone fallback behavior.

## 6W Snapshot (Who/What/Why/How/When/Where)

| Question | Plain-language answer |
|---|---|
| Who is this for? | Plugin users, operators, QA/release owners, and coding agents/scripts that need one reliable source of truth. |
| What is changing? | BL-009: Steam Headphone Contract Closeout |
| Why is this important? | Established Steam Audio binaural rendering contract with deterministic headphone fallback behavior. |
| How will we deliver it? | Use the documented implementation summary and promotion gates in this closeout runbook to confirm what shipped and why it is safe. |
| When is it done? | This item is complete when promotion gates, evidence sync, and backlog/index status updates are all recorded as done. |
| Where is the source of truth? | Runbook: `Documentation/backlog/done/bl-009-steam-headphone-contract.md` plus repo-local evidence under `TestEvidence/...`. |

## Visual Aid Index

Use visuals only when they improve understanding; prefer compact tables first.

| Visual Aid | Why it helps | Where to find it |
|---|---|---|
| Status Ledger table | Gives a fast plain-language view of priority, state, dependencies, and ownership. | `## Status Ledger` |
| Promotion gate table | Shows what passed/failed for closeout decisions. | `## Promotion Gate Summary` |
| Optional diagram/screenshot/chart | Use only when it makes complex behavior easier to understand than text alone. | Link under the most relevant section (usually validation or evidence). |


## Status Ledger

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Priority | P1 |
| Status | Done |
| Completed | 2026-02-23 |
| Owner Track | Track A Runtime Formats |

## Objective

Established Steam Audio binaural rendering contract with deterministic headphone fallback behavior.

## What Was Built

- Steam Audio C API integration for binaural rendering
- Headphone profile detection
- Deterministic fallback to generic HRTF when Steam Audio unavailable
- Profile diagnostics publication

## Key Files

- `Source/SpatialRenderer.h`
- `Source/PluginProcessor.cpp`

## Evidence References

- `TestEvidence/build-summary.md`
- Production self-test with Steam Audio binaural lanes

## Completion Date

2026-02-23


## Governance Retrofit (2026-02-28)

This additive retrofit preserves historical closeout context while aligning this done runbook with current backlog governance templates.

### Status Ledger Addendum

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Promotion Decision Packet | `Legacy packet; see Evidence References and related owner sync artifacts.` |
| Final Evidence Root | `Legacy TestEvidence bundle(s); see Evidence References.` |
| Archived Runbook Path | `Documentation/backlog/done/bl-009-steam-headphone-contract.md` |

### Promotion Gate Summary

| Gate | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Build + smoke | Legacy closeout documented | `Evidence References` |
| Lane replay/parity | Legacy closeout documented | `Evidence References` |
| RT safety | Legacy closeout documented | `Evidence References` |
| Docs freshness | Legacy closeout documented | `Evidence References` |
| Status schema | Legacy closeout documented | `Evidence References` |
| Ownership safety (`SHARED_FILES_TOUCHED`) | Required for modern promotions; legacy packets may predate marker | `Evidence References` |

### Backlog/Status Sync Checklist

- [x] Runbook archived under `Documentation/backlog/done/`
- [x] Backlog index links the done runbook
- [x] Historical evidence references retained
- [ ] Legacy packet retrofitted to modern owner packet template (`_template-promotion-decision.md`) where needed
- [ ] Legacy closeout fully normalized to modern checklist fields where needed
