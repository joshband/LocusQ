# BL-005: Preset Save Host Path Fix

## Status Ledger

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Priority | P0 |
| Status | Done |
| Completed | 2026-02-21 |
| Owner Track | B Scene/UI Runtime |

## Objective

Fixed preset file path resolution in host environments where the default save directory was incorrectly resolved, causing preset loss.

## What Was Built

- Corrected file path resolution for host-managed preset directories

## Key Files

- `Source/PluginProcessor.cpp`

## Evidence References

- Production self-test baseline (part of initial P0 closeout cycle)
- `TestEvidence/build-summary.md` and `TestEvidence/validation-trend.md` entries

## Completion Date

2026-02-21


## Governance Retrofit (2026-02-28)

This additive retrofit preserves historical closeout context while aligning this done runbook with current backlog governance templates.

### Backlog/Status Sync Checklist

- [x] Runbook archived under `Documentation/backlog/done/`
- [x] Backlog index links the done runbook
- [x] Historical evidence references retained
- [ ] Legacy packet retrofitted to modern owner packet template (`_template-promotion-decision.md`) where needed
- [ ] Legacy closeout fully normalized to modern checklist fields where needed
