# BL-007: Velocity Vector Overlays

## Status Ledger

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Priority | P0 |
| Status | Done |
| Completed | 2026-02-21 |
| Owner Track | B Scene/UI Runtime |

## Objective

Added arrow overlays showing emitter velocity direction and magnitude in the 3D viewport, driven by physics engine state.

## What Was Built

- Velocity arrow geometry
- Magnitude-to-length scaling
- Physics velocity field publication in scene snapshot

## Key Files

- `Source/ui/public/js/index.js`
- `Source/SceneGraph.h`

## Evidence References

- Production self-test baseline (part of initial P0 closeout cycle)
- `TestEvidence/build-summary.md` and `TestEvidence/validation-trend.md` entries

## Completion Date

2026-02-21


## Governance Retrofit (2026-02-28)

This additive retrofit preserves historical closeout context while aligning this done runbook with current backlog governance templates.

### Status Ledger Addendum

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Promotion Decision Packet | `Legacy packet; see Evidence References and related owner sync artifacts.` |
| Final Evidence Root | `Legacy TestEvidence bundle(s); see Evidence References.` |
| Archived Runbook Path | `Documentation/backlog/done/bl-007-velocity-vector-overlays.md` |

### Promotion Gate Summary

| Gate | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Build + smoke | Legacy closeout documented | `Evidence References` |
| Lane replay/parity | Legacy closeout documented | `Evidence References` |
| RT safety | Legacy closeout documented | `Evidence References` |
| Docs freshness | Legacy closeout documented | `Evidence References` |
| Status schema | Legacy closeout documented | `Evidence References` |
| Ownership safety (`SHARED_FILES_TOUCHED`) | Required for modern promotions; legacy packets may predate marker | `Evidence References` |

### Backlog/Status Sync Checklist

- [x] Runbook archived under `Documentation/backlog/done/`
- [x] Backlog index links the done runbook
- [x] Historical evidence references retained
- [ ] Legacy packet retrofitted to modern owner packet template (`_template-promotion-decision.md`) where needed
- [ ] Legacy closeout fully normalized to modern checklist fields where needed
