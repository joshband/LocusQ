## Objective

Added arrow overlays showing emitter velocity direction and magnitude in the 3D viewport, driven by physics engine state.

## What Was Built

- Velocity arrow geometry
- Magnitude-to-length scaling
- Physics velocity field publication in scene snapshot

## Key Files

- `Source/ui/public/js/index.js`
- `Source/SceneGraph.h`

## Evidence References

- Production self-test baseline (part of initial P0 closeout cycle)
- `TestEvidence/build-summary.md` and `TestEvidence/validation-trend.md` entries

## Completion Date
