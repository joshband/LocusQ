# BL-006: Motion Trail Overlays

## Plain-Language Summary

BL-006 in plain terms: Added visual motion trail paths for emitters in the 3D viewport, showing historical position trace as a fading polyline overlay. Current state: Done. For technical detail, see `## Objective` and `## Validation Plan`.

## 6W Snapshot (Who/What/Why/How/When/Where)

| Question | Plain-language answer |
|---|---|
| Who is this for? | Plugin users, operators, QA/release owners, and coding agents/scripts that need one reliable source of truth. |
| What is changing? | BL-006: Motion Trail Overlays |
| Why is this important? | Added visual motion trail paths for emitters in the 3D viewport, showing historical position trace as a fading polyline overlay. |
| How will we deliver it? | Use the documented implementation summary and promotion gates in this closeout runbook to confirm what shipped and why it is safe. |
| When is it done? | This item is complete when promotion gates, evidence sync, and backlog/index status updates are all recorded as done. |
| Where is the source of truth? | Runbook: `Documentation/backlog/done/bl-006-motion-trail-overlays.md` plus repo-local evidence under `TestEvidence/...`. |

## Visual Aid Index

Use visuals only when they materially improve understanding.

| Visual Aid | Why it helps | Where to find it |
|---|---|---|
| Status ledger | Fast state/priority/dependency scan for humans and agents. | `## Status Ledger` |
| Validation and evidence tables | Shows pass/fail criteria and artifact contract. | `## Validation Plan` |
| Optional item-specific diagram | Include only when it clarifies behavior better than prose/tables. | Adjacent to the relevant section |
