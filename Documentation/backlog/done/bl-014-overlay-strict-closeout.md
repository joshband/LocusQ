# BL-014: Listener/Speaker/Aim/RMS Overlay Strict Closeout

## Status Ledger

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Priority | P1 |
| Status | Done |
| Completed | 2026-02-24 |
| Owner Track | Track B Scene/UI Runtime |

## Objective

Finalized all viewport overlay confidence lanes (listener position, speaker positions, aim direction, RMS rings) with strict deterministic evidence.

## What Was Built

- Deterministic overlay rendering contracts
- Strict self-test assertions for each overlay type
- Evidence bundle with probe-level granularity

## Key Files

- `Source/ui/public/js/index.js`
- `Source/SceneGraph.h`
- `Source/PluginProcessor.cpp`

## Evidence References

- `TestEvidence/locusq_production_p0_selftest_20260224T032239Z.json`
- `TestEvidence/locusq_smoke_suite_spatial_bl014_20260224T032355Z.log`

## Completion Date

## Governance Retrofit (2026-02-28)

This additive retrofit preserves historical closeout context while aligning this done runbook with current backlog governance templates.

### Status Ledger Addendum

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Promotion Decision Packet | `Legacy packet; see Evidence References and related owner sync artifacts.` |
| Final Evidence Root | `Legacy TestEvidence bundle(s); see Evidence References.` |
| Archived Runbook Path | `Documentation/backlog/done/bl-014-overlay-strict-closeout.md` |

### Promotion Gate Summary

| Gate | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Build + smoke | Legacy closeout documented | `Evidence References` |
| Lane replay/parity | Legacy closeout documented | `Evidence References` |
| RT safety | Legacy closeout documented | `Evidence References` |
| Docs freshness | Legacy closeout documented | `Evidence References` |
| Status schema | Legacy closeout documented | `Evidence References` |
| Ownership safety (`SHARED_FILES_TOUCHED`) | Required for modern promotions; legacy packets may predate marker | `Evidence References` |

### Backlog/Status Sync Checklist

- [x] Runbook archived under `Documentation/backlog/done/`
- [x] Backlog index links the done runbook
- [x] Historical evidence references retained
- [ ] Legacy packet retrofitted to modern owner packet template (`_template-promotion-decision.md`) where needed
- [ ] Legacy closeout fully normalized to modern checklist fields where needed
