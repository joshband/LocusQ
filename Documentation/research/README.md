# LocusQ Research Index

## Purpose
Keep active research discoverable while moving superseded historical research to the archive.

## Active Research (Current)
1. `Documentation/research/locusq-headtracking-binaural-methodology-2026-02-28.md` (canonical methodology for BL-053..BL-060 execution planning)
2. `Documentation/research/Claude Research - Building a head-tracked spatial audio DAW plugin with AirPods Pro 2.md`
3. `Documentation/research/LocusQ Headphone Calibration Research Outline.md`
4. `Documentation/research/Headphone Calibration for 3D Audio.pdf`

## Archived Research (Legacy)
Legacy research moved on 2026-02-25:
1. `Documentation/archive/2026-02-25-research-legacy/quadraphonic-audio-spatialization-next-steps.md`
2. `Documentation/archive/2026-02-25-research-legacy/Quadraphonic Audio Spatialization.pdf`
3. `Documentation/archive/2026-02-25-research-legacy/qa-harness-upstream-backport-opportunities-2026-02-20.md`
4. `Documentation/archive/2026-02-25-research-legacy/section0-integration-recommendations-2026-02-20.md`

## Notes
- Research documents are Tier 2 reference materials unless explicitly promoted to Tier 0/Tier 1 via ADR or canonical docs updates.
- Backlog status authority remains `Documentation/backlog/index.md`; this research index is discoverability-oriented.
