# BL-075 Tracker Issue Draft

## Proposed Title

BL-075: code comment and API documentation accessibility review

## Summary

Review and improve in-code comments and API documentation quality so non-obvious logic and integration contracts are understandable for both human and AI contributors.

## Evidence

- Contributor request (2026-03-01): improve code accessibility and explanation quality where logic/decisions are non-obvious.
- `Documentation/reviews/2026-03-01-code-review-backlog-reprioritization.md` (noted maintainability and diagnostics clarity opportunities).

## Acceptance Checklist

- [ ] Non-obvious logic paths include concise rationale comments.
- [ ] Public/shared API contracts are documented and current.
- [ ] Stale/misleading comments are remediated.
- [ ] Contributor-facing API entrypoint map is published.
- [ ] Changes preserve architecture + RT-safety invariant language.
