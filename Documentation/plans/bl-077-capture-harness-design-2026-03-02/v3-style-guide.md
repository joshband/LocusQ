# v3 Style Guide (Recommended)

## Design Direction
- Industrial QA dashboard tone: precise, calm, and explicit.
- Prioritize confidence and repeatability over visual novelty.

## Visual Tokens (HTML Preview)
- Background gradient: midnight blue -> steel navy.
- Primary accent: electric cyan.
- Success: spring green.
- Warning: warm amber.
- Error: signal red.

## Typographic Contract
- Mono for telemetry/cues.
- Medium-weight sans for headers in preview docs only.
- Keep line length compact for terminal parity.

## Interaction Rules
- Surface one primary next action at each failure point.
- Keep checkpoint naming consistent between cue stream and artifact filenames.
- Preserve deterministic ordering for all emitted tables/manifests.
