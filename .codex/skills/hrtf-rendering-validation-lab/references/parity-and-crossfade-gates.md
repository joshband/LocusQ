# Parity And Crossfade Gates

Crossfade gate:
- direction/profile updates must be artifact-safe (no zipper/click events).

Parity gate:
- baseline nearest-neighbor and interpolation results must be compared with a stable metric set.
- promotion requires reproducible evidence packet, not one-off subjective notes.
