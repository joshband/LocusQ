Title: Simulation Model Families

## Candidate Families
- Flocking/swarm models for distributed motion behavior.
- Crowd-field models for directional mass movement and density flow.
- Flow-inspired field dynamics for fluid-like directional coupling.
- Hybrid interaction layers combining attraction/repulsion/collision energy.

## Selection Criteria
- Audible value per CPU cost.
- Visual legibility under realtime constraints.
- Deterministic replay suitability.
- Host/plugin portability and failure semantics.
