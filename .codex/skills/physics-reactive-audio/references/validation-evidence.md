# Validation and Evidence

## Minimum Matrix
- Idle baseline (no motion)
- Moderate motion
- Peak entity/interaction load
- Stress transitions (start/stop, preset switches)

## Record
- CPU usage and xruns/dropouts
- Output stability (NaN/Inf checks)
- Audible outcome notes per scenario
- Regression deltas vs previous baseline
