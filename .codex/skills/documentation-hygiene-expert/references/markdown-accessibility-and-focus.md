# Markdown Accessibility And Focus

## Readability Rules
- Lead with purpose and scope before implementation detail.
- Use clear section titles and short paragraphs.
- Prefer explicit claims over vague or future-tense wording.
- Replace repeated prose with canonical links and concise summaries.

## Accessibility Rules
- Use heading hierarchy consistently (`#`, `##`, `###`).
- Use descriptive link text, not raw URL dumps.
- Keep tables scannable and avoid overloaded cells.
- Use code fences with language tags for commands/snippets.

## Anti-Bloat Checks
- Remove repeated definitions that exist in canonical docs.
- Move historical deep detail into archive or references when no longer operationally needed.
- Keep operational docs decision-oriented: what changed, why, impact, and next action.
