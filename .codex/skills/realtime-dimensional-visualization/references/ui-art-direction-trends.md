Title: UI Art Direction for Plugin Visualization

Use this reference for intentional, modern interface direction without sacrificing operator clarity.

## Art Direction Guardrails
- Pick a clear visual identity per surface; avoid interchangeable boilerplate UI.
- Use typographic hierarchy deliberately to separate control, status, and diagnostics.
- Use color semantically (state, warning, confidence) rather than decorative noise.
- Use motion to explain state changes, not as constant ornament.

## Realtime Readability
- Keep critical diagnostics visible under motion.
- Prefer consistent anchor zones for changing values.
- Keep rapid updates stable with smoothing/deadband where needed.
