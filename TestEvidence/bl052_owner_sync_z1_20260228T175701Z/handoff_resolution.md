# BL-052 Handoff Resolution Z1

## Ownership Safety

- `SHARED_FILES_TOUCHED: no`
- Scope: backlog/docs synchronization and closeout evidence packet only.

## Evidence Localization

- Canonical promotion artifacts are repository-local under `TestEvidence/`.
- No canonical artifact depends on `/tmp`.
