# Backlog Governance Alignment Summary

## Scope

Retrofit and conformance alignment for backlog lifecycle and replay-cadence governance across open and done backlog runbooks.

## Results

- Open runbooks compliant: 27/27
- Done runbooks with additive governance retrofit: 46/46
- Lifecycle/cadence authority docs synchronized:
  - `Documentation/backlog/index.md`
  - `Documentation/standards.md`
  - `Documentation/README.md`
  - Backlog templates (`_template-intake.md`, `_template-runbook.md`, `_template-promotion-decision.md`, `_template-closeout.md`)

## Notes

- Retrofit was additive for done runbooks and preserved historical closeout narrative/evidence sections.
- Canonical promotion evidence localization contract now explicitly requires repository-local `TestEvidence/` paths.
